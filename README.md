A min-max-heap is like a binary heap, but it allows extracting both the
minimum and maximum value efficiently. In particular, finding either the
minimum or maximum element is `O(1)`. A removal of either extremum, or
an insertion, is `O(log n)`.

## Usage

Itâ€™s [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/min-max-heap), so add
this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
min-max-heap = "1.3.0"
```

This crate supports Rust version 1.41.1 and later.

## References

My reference for a min-max heap is
[here](http://cglab.ca/~morin/teaching/5408/refs/minmax.pdf). Much
of this code is also based on `BinaryHeap` from the standard
library.
